# printer-info-formatter

This little script I wrote saves me minutes a day! It doesn't sound much, but it all adds up. Keeping all my printer info in a spreadsheet means when I'm talking to someone about a specific printer or need to send off a request for a service/replacement etc. the info copied into Outlook or ticketing systems is messy and hard to read.The formatted info is returned already on the clipboard, meaning you can just paste straight away after using the script. Below is an example of the final output.
